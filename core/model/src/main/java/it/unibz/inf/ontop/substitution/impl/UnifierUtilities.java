 * Note: The the unifier does not distinguish between undistinguished variables
 * i.e.when we have an atom A(#,#) which should be unified with B(b,c) the
 * unifier willreturn two thetas #/b, #/c. So far so good but this will lead to
 * problems whenapplying the thetas because there is no distinction between
 * #-variables, sothe first theta is applied to all #-variables and the rest is
 * ignored.In order to avoid problems one can enumerate the undistinguished
 * variables ie. A(#1,#2)
